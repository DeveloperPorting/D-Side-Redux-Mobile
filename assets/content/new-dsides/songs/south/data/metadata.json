Boyfriend and Girlfriend are scouting out the Dearests' Party Castle before their annual Halloween party begins, but when they enter, they find...Girlfriend's (not blood-related) cousins, Skid and Pump! Seems they showed up early to start the festivities before anyone showed up, and they're having fun, dancing and eating their Halloween Candy! They offer for BF and GF to join the fun, so who are they to deny that?"
