    "description": "The furious grim reaper, Zardy, finally confronts Pump, the ghost who has been escaping death for months now. Pump doesn't seem to realize that he's been doing this, though, and doesn't understand why this guy in the awesome Halloween costume is so mad! He chained up Ms. Lila, but his costume is great! Maybe a little dance will calm him down?"
