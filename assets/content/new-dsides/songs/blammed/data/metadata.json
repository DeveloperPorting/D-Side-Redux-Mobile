    "description": "On the way back to Girlfriend's place, the couple is discussing one of GF's favorite games, when they're suddenly stopped by a short man with a fucking stupid hair-do. I mean, just the stupidest 'do you've ever seen. BF knew that stupid haircut anywhere, though. It was his ex-boyfriend, Pico! He points a gun directly at BF's face, claiming that he's got some bills to pay, as well as some...personal debt. BF laughs in his face, tossing him a microphone."
