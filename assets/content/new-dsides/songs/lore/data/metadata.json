    "description": "One night, Mr. Afton is sitting in his living room, when a crazed conspiracy theorist, Mack, breaks in to confront him! For some reason, Mack seems to believe that Afton is some kind of...crazed child murderer. He thinks that Afton killed 5 kids, after the death of his youngest child. What a load of crap! Mack is lucky that Afton isn't an aggressive man. He knows someone who is, though!"
