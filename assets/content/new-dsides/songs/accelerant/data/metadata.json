    "description": "On a leisurely visit to BF's favorite club in Florida, a scarfed man in cowboy attire violently clears the building, leaving 3 people inside, himself, BF and GF. GF is too focused on manning the DJ table to realize the full caliber of whats going on, but the cowboy man seems to want the head of our purple punk, while 2 others in the shadows are looking to...retrieve GF?."
