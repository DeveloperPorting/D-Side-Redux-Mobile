    "description": "On a trip to the beach, Boyfriend and Girlfriend spot former rockstar, Whitty, sulking on the deck above the beach. They approach him and ask what the problem is. He seems fine with Boyfriend, but as soon as he notices Girlfriend...well, let's just say his attitude shifts. He asks for his privacy, as he just wants to be left alone after all he's went through. But of course, our duo can't make it easy for him."
