		desc: "Four years ago, on one fateful May in 2021, I was on my way home whilst being high as hell on some medicine I can't recall the name of after a doctor's visit. Right as we pull out, I have the barely-conscious thought of \"If I were to make my own FNF remix mod, the characters would all have different designs instead of just being recolours.\" During that ride home, I made the first sketch of D-Sides Boyfriend, with scruffy hair and a warning sign on the shirt. After talking about the concept for a bit, someone by the name of PhilipLol offered to make music and code for it. Once the mod was actually becoming real, I asked my friend Fifleo if he'd be down to make sprites for it sometime. Then, another friend of mine, gc, asked if he could compose some songs for Pico.\n\nThat's how it all started. 3 kids (and gc), working together to make a fun little mod that wasn't meant to be played by anyone outside of their respective friend groups. Never could any of us imagine that it would turn into the phenomenon that D-Sides is today, let alone us having...actual fanbases. It's so surreal to live in. D-Sides has gotten so large to the point where my sister recently became friends with someone and found out that her child likes FNF and has played D-Sides. Do you know how insane that was for me? That may be the moment where I realized what people meant when they say \"it's a small world\", as fuckin' corny as that is to say.\n\nIn these 4 years, I have met some of the kindest people. It would genuinely take too long to list everyone, but just about everyone you'll find in the credits here are just some of the fantastic people I've met. Despite all the shit that goes on in this community, I even love my fans. Yes, even you, player. I love you. Unless you're a child, then I think you're cool.  The FNF community has done so much more for me than most people would think. You guys have helped pay for an expensive surgery I desperately needed. The amount of times you guys have indirectly fed me and my family is...too many to count. And I appreciate that. Deeply. I'll never be able to repay what all of you have done for me, and the many, many other people on this mod that have gained their own opportunities in life thanks to D-Sides and all of you.\n\nThank you for everything. I hope you all enjoyed D-Sides 1.0 Redux. And I can promise that there are many more updates to come.",

		desc: "I have been on FNF: D-Sides since early 2022, being added as the sole programmer since their (at the time) main programmer had left to persue other asperations. I was very nervous at first, D-Sides was a highly acclaimed mod at the time and I didn't wanna mess up infront of these people that I looked up to. Little did I know, working on D-Sides would introduce me to / further develop relationships with some of the greatest friends I have to this day. I am forever greatful that I had the opportunity to meet people like DastardlyDeacon, EllisBros, FifLeo, Kloogybaboogy, squishyzumorizu, and others. You are some of the kindest, most taleneted people I know and being able to work on a project that means this much to me would not be the same without y'all. Thank you for not immediately hating little 15-year-old me, LOL.\n\nD-Sides is by far the most proud I have ever been of my own work. Every single menu & transition was coded by me and me alone. I also programmed songs like South, Monster,  Improbable Outset, Boom Bash, Foolhardy, Try Harder, Endless, Milk, AND, dguy, Lore, Performance, Execution, and literally every OG song (note: i didn't solo code some of these, and i'm also probably forgetting some.. death to useraqua). I will absolutely be putting some of my work on my professional portfolio, I'm proud of everything I've put into this mod and I am beyond excited to continue to work with these lovely people.\n\nEvery single bit of programming in this mod has been implemented via soft-coding in my own personal psych engine fork entitled NightmareVision that I have been developing over the past few years alongside Data5. Working on this mod in my own framework has led to insane developments in said engine and I am absolutely astonished with the strides made. But I can't talk about how proud I am of the engine or mod without thanking Data. You have done some INSANE work on NMV and I am so unbelievably thankful, you're a huge help and I hope you know how much I appreciate you bro. Six seven\n\nStay creative man,  and never give up on your passion because of others. The FNF community can get bad sometimes, there's no denying that, but that will never stop be from being passionate about the game that changed my life and lead to me developing and expanding upon my talents. Stay cool, stay creative, and stay funky.\n\n- Cam Campbell, 11.18.25",
