    "description": "Ivo & Maria are sent on a mission to grab all the gum they can around the schoolhouse. When they do so, they return to where they received the mission, only to find that the little guy that told them to do that is just...not there. Instead, there's Sunky with his best friend Eemie, much to Ivo's dismay. He's not very happy to be there."
