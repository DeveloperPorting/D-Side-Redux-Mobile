    "description": "When BF downloads a suspicious fangame from a shady website, he starts to play it as GF watches when Dearest tries to give him the same treatment he gave to Dwayne and teleports BF into the game, accidentally sending GF inside as well. Inside, they meet Mighty the Armadillo. Even though they're in an ice land, it's...disturbingly cold. Mighty's very voice is enough to send a chill down their spine. Is everything as it seems here?"
