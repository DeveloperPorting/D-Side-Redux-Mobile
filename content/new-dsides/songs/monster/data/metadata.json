    "description": "When Pump mindlessly tosses a piece of cherry candy over his shoulder, it falls into a vat of chemicals, left out by Skid's mother, Lila. The Dearests allowed her to use the castle for her experiments when they weren't using it. She was supposed to come over later that day and remove everything, but Skid and Pump showed up earlier. When the candy lands in the vat, it begins to grow limbs and one, giant eye. It crawls out and only knows one thing: hunger. And the nearest snacks are Boyfriend and Girlfriend. Girlfriend urges her cousins to leave so they can handle the monster themselves."
